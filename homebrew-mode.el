;; # hombrew-mode

;; Emacs minor mode for editing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae.

;; ## setup

;; ```elisp
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/where/is/homebrew-mode")
;; (require 'homebrew-mode)
;; (homebrew-mode-default-hooks)
;; ```

;; ## keys and commands

;; The command prefix is <kbd>C-c h</kbd>.  These are the commands currently mapped to it:

;; - <kbd>C-c h f</kbd>: Download the source file(s) for the formula
;;   in the current buffer.

;; - <kbd>C-c h u</kbd>: Download and unpack the source file(s) for the formula
;;   in the current buffer.

;; - <kbd>C-c h i</kbd>: Install the formula in the current buffer.

;; - <kbd>C-c h r</kbd>: Uninstall the formula in the current buffer.

;; - <kbd>C-c h t</kbd>: Run the test for the formula in the current buffer.

;; - <kbd>C-c h a</kbd>: Audit the formula in the current buffer.

;; - <kbd>C-c h c</kbd>: Open a dired buffer in the Homebrew cache
;;   (default `/Library/Caches/Homebrew`).

;; - <kbd>C-c h d</kbd>: Add `depends_on` lines for the specified
;;   formulae.  Call with one prefix (<kbd>C-u</kbd>) argument to make
;;   them build-time dependencies; call with two (<kbd>C-u C-u</kbd>) for
;;   run-time.

;; - <kbd>C-c h p</kbd>: Insert Python `resource` blocks (requires poet,
;;   installed with `pip install homebrew-pypi-poet`).

;; ## custom variables

;; - If you’re using Linuxbrew or a non-standard prefix on Mac OS, you’ll
;;   need to update `homebrew-prefix` to point at your `brew –-prefix`.

;; - If you’re using Linuxbrew or have your cache in a non-standard
;;   location on Mac OS, update `homebrew-cache-dir`.

;; - If you want to turn on whitespace-mode when editing formulae that
;;   have inline patches, set `homebrew-patch-whitespace-mode` to
;;   `t`. It’s off by default since it looks ugly.

;;; Requires:

(require 'dired)
(require 'diff-mode)

;;; Code:

(defconst homebrew-mode-version "0.4.0")
